# Maps App Android

This repo provides an example app for Android devices called Maps App that can be used as a
starter for your organization's mapping app built with [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/). You can use the Maps App as is, or extend it using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android.

Visit Esri's [**open source apps site**](https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/maps-app/) to read more about this app and how the Runtime features are implemented.

## Detailed Documentation

Read the [docs](./docs/README.md) for a detailed explanation of the application, including its architecture and how it leverages the ArcGIS platform, as well as how you can begin using the app right away.

## Development Instructions

This Maps App repo is an Android Studio Project and App Module that can be directly cloned and imported into Android Studio. In addition, you'll need to follow the steps below to obtain your client id and redirect uri. Both are required for leveraging all the features of the app.

* Log in to [ArcGIS for Developers](https://developers.arcgis.com/) and [register](https://developers.arcgis.com/applications/#/) your app.  

![](/docs/images/Register1.png)

* Once you've registered your version of the maps-app, grab a copy of the client id from the registration and set the client id in the applications app_settings.xml file.  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <!-- TODO: add your OAuth Client ID here-->
    <string name="client_id">YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
    <!-- This redirect URI is the default value for https://www.arcgis.com -->
    <string name="redirect_uri">my-ags-app://auth</string>
    <!-- The following values are used in the Robotium tests only -->
    <string name="username">YOUR_PORTAL_USERNAME</string>
    <string name="password">YOUR_PORTAL_PASSWORD</string>
    <string name="testPartialName">vo</string>
</resources>
```

* As part of the registration process, add a redirect uri for your app.  Navigate to the Redirect URIs section at the bottom of the registration page and set the redirect uri to `my-ags-app://auth`.  This redirect uri is the default redirect for `https://www.arcgis.com`.

* Note that the scheme for the `DefaultOAuthIntentReceiver` in the Android Manifest file is derived from the redirect uri.

```xml
        <activity
            android:name="com.esri.arcgisruntime.security.DefaultOAuthIntentReceiver"
            android:label="OAuthIntentReceiver"
            android:launchMode="singleTask">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>

                <data android:scheme="my-ags-app"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
```

### Fork the repo

**Fork** the [Maps App Android](https://github.com/Esri/maps-app-android/fork) repo

### Clone the repo

Once you have forked the repo, you can make a clone

#### Command line Git

1. [Clone the Maps App repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#step-2-clone-your-fork)
2. ```cd``` into the ```maps-app-android``` folder
3. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

### Configuring a Remote for a Fork

If you make changes in the fork and would like to [sync](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) those changes with the upstream repository, you must first [configure the remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/). This will be required when you have created local branches and would like to make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to your upstream branch.

1. In the Terminal (for Mac users) or command prompt (for Windows and Linux users) type ```git remote -v``` to list the current configured remote repo for your fork.
2. ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/Esri/maps-app-android.git``` to specify new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork. You can type ```git remote -v``` to verify the new upstream.

If there are changes made in the Original repository, you can sync the fork to keep it updated with upstream repository.

1. In the terminal, change the current working directory to your local project
2. Type ```git fetch upstream``` to fetch the commits from the upstream repository
3. ```git checkout master``` to checkout your fork's local master branch.
4. ```git merge upstream/master``` to sync your local `master' branch with `upstream/master`. **Note**: Your local changes will be retained and your fork's master branch will be in sync with the upstream repository.
